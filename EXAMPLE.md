## Why This Format Works

### Structured Reflection
- **Weather & Mood** - Track patterns over time
- **Intentions** - Start each day with purpose
- **Highlights** - Celebrate what went well
- **Reflections** - Process experiences and insights
- **Gratitude** - Build positive mindset
- **Tomorrow's Focus** - Bridge to the next day

### Searchable History
With Leaf's search function, you can easily find:
```bash
leaf find "coffee"       # All coffee-related entries
leaf find "grateful"     # Gratitude patterns
leaf find "mood: 8"      # Good mood days
leaf find "presentation" # Work-related entries
```

### Mobile-Friendly
The emoji structure makes it easy to:
- **Quickly scan** sections on mobile
- **Add thoughts** throughout the day
- **Complete sections** as time allows
- **Maintain consistency** across devices
```
